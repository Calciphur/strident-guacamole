/*  The task: A happy number is defined by the following process.
    Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the
    sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process
    until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops
    endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers
    for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while
    those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.
